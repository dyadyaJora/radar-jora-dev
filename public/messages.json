          "Throughout my journey in this industry over the years, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide array of technologies and tools. Some technologies become obsolete and disappear in history, while others I've bid farewell to as my career took new directions. Among the vast landscape of tech, there's a core set of technologies I've come to master with confidence, wielding them to develop software and operate it for robust production systems. On the flip side, I use some other technologies rarely, or only a few times for simple pet or educational projects. Over time, it becomes relevant for myself to observe my current technology stack, reflecting on the arsenal of knowledge I possess now, as well as the various technologies I've explored at some point along the way.",
